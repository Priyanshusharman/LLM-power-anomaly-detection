25/11/23, 17:16 - Priyanshu: Absolutely, here's the complete code for the `myFun` function and the `main` function in JavaScript:

```javascript
function myFun(email) {
    if (email.includes('@')) {
        return 'Yes';
    } else {
        return 'No';
    }
}

function main() {
    console.log(myFun('jjejj.com')); // Should output: No
    console.log(myFun('jj.com')); // Should output: No
    console.log(myFun('someone@example.com')); // Should output: Yes
}

main();
```

This code includes both the `myFun` function, which checks for the presence of the '@' symbol in an email string and returns 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly, and the `main` function, which runs sample test cases for the `myFun` function.

09/12/23, 12:05 - Nayan Soni: The Post Correspondence Problem (PCP) is a mathematical problem in the field of formal languages and automata theory. It was introduced by Emil Post in 1946. The problem can be described as follows:

Given a set of tiles, each with a string written on the top and bottom, can you arrange some of these tiles in such a way that when you read the strings from the top or bottom, they form the same sequence of characters?

More formally, given a finite set of pairs of strings (dominoes), the question is whether there exists a sequence of these dominos such that when you concatenate the corresponding strings from the top or bottom of each domino, you get the same string.

The Post Correspondence Problem is known to be undecidable, which means there is no algorithm that can determine whether a solution exists for any arbitrary set of tiles. This result is a consequence of the undecidability of the halting problem, and it highlights the limitations of algorithmic approaches in certain mathematical problems.

fraction. Numbers in the mantissa and exponent are in signed-magnitude 
representation. What are the largest and smallest positive quantities that can 
be represented, excluding zero?

4-tc>-1-line multipleJ<erS to the inputs of a fifth register, RS. Each register is

To through T, as foUows: 
To: RS+-RO 
To: RS<-Rl

The timing variables are mutuaUy e>cclusive, which means that only one variable is equal to I at any given time, while the other tlwe are equal to 
0. Draw a block diagram showing the hanfware Implementation of the 
register transfers. Include the connections nettSSoll)' from the four timing 
variables to the selection inputs of the multiplexers and to the load input of 
register RS.
